CIRE - Coinitial IRE 
If [t] ci [u] and t, u are coinitial => t ι u

Polychotomy
L is a pre-reversible LTSI if whenever e, e' forward events only one holds:
e = e'   e<e'   e'<e   e#e'   e ci e' 

NRE - No Repeated Events
In any rooted path r, for any forward event e we have #(r, e) ≤ 1

RED - Reverse Event Determinism
t, t' backward transitions and t~t' => t=t'
L pre-reversible => (NRE <=> RED <=> ci irreflexive on events <=> polychotomy holds)

L coinitial combined??? LTSI I binary relation on Lab
for any coinitial transitions t: P-α->Q and u: P-->R we have t ι u <=> I(a,b) where a = und(α) and b = und(β)
